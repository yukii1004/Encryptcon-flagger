## Behavioral Analytics for Detecting Anomalies in Financial Transactions
### Problem Statement
- Behavioral Analytics for Detecting Anomalies in Financial Transactions 
**Track:** "Behavioral Analytics for Security"
**Challenge:** Implement and improve behavioral analytics solutions that can detect anomalies in financial transactions, providing enhanced security against fraudulent activities.
### Goal
- The primary aim of this model is to optimize and fortify each phase of fraud detection, significantly improving efficiency and accuracy. 
- Simultaneously, it aims to proactively prevent fraudulent transactions with a reduced utilization of resources.
### Scope
- Enhance fraud detection through improved feature engineering, incorporating transaction frequency and user behavior.
- Implement real-time monitoring with sub-second latency, providing prompt insights into transaction patterns.
- Utilize behavioral analytics to identify evolving patterns, contributing to  reduction in false positives.
### Methodology
- ** Data Collection : ** Comprehensive dataset gathered for both normal and fraudulent transactions, ensuring real-world representation.
- ** Data Preprocessing : ** Thorough cleaning and preprocessing, handling missing values, outliers, and prioritizing privacy.
- ** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): ** EDA provided insights into feature distribution, relationships, and patterns.
- ** Data Splitting: ** Dataset split into training and testing sets, reserving a portion for evaluating model performance on new data.
- ** Model Selection: ** Consideration and experimentation with machine learning algorithms for anomaly detection.
- ** Model Training: ** Selected model trained on the dataset, fine-tuning hyperparameters with cross-validation for robustness.
- ** Model Evaluation:  ** Evaluation of model performance on the testing dataset, adjusting based on relevant metrics.
